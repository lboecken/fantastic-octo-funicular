1.X  While there are tokens to be read:
2.X        Read a token
3.X        If it's a number add it to queue
4.X        If it's an operator
5.               While there's an operator on the top of the stack with greater precedence:
6.                       Pop operators from the stack onto the output queue
7.               Push the current operator onto the stack
8. X       If it's a left bracket push it onto the stack
9. X       If it's a right bracket 
10. X           While there's not a left bracket at the top of the stack:
11. X                    Pop operators from the stack onto the output queue.
12.  X           Pop the left bracket from the stack and discard it
13. While there are operators on the stack, pop them to the queue
